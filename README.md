# Telecom-Churn
Find the telecom churners through ML algorithms
In Telecom churn model was in some datasets its really bad at detecting churners(especially in successful telecom N?W's - we dont fing portouts), if we train model on unbalanced data , it's useless model but it will manage to get an accuracy of 99% and a low recall value of 5% for example (because it's only able to detect the not-churn people). The problem here isn't specifically that we just have a low recall value.
